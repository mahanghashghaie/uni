One of the caveats of this k-means implementation is, that at every run of the k-means method our clusters are initialized at random.
That means there is no way to consistently recreate the same image by rerunning the kmeans method

One other problem of this is, that initially cluster centers could be very very close that it would make sense use 1 cluster for all the points belonging to both clusters

For the first problem, one could make it so that the initialization takes the shape of the image into regard and always takes the same k coordinates from the image in the range of the shape

For the second problem, one could calculate the overall error of both clusters and compare it to the overall error of a new merged cluster, computed by the mean of the points of both former clusters. if the overall error of this new cluster is lower we would use this as a new cluster and drop the former 2
